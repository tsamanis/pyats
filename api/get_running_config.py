All available device APIs 
https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/genie-feature-browser/docs/#/apis

Genie has a set of built in API functions that can be used to perform 
various actions including config, verify, get, analyze, and more on the 
device. They can be accessed directly with the device.apis method. To use 
them, simply find the API name you need, then call the API with itâ€™s 
argument as: device.api.api_name(args_1, args_2, ....)

# Find the device I want to connect to
device = testbed.devices['R2']

# Connect to it
device.connect()
running_config=device.api.get_running_config_dict()

# Print it nicely
pprint.pprint(running_config)
